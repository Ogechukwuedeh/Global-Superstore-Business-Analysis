# Global-Superstore-Business-Analysis
End-to-end sales analytics project using Excel, SQL, and Power BI.

# Project Overview
This project transforms raw retail sales data into actionable business insights using an end-to-end analytics workflow:

# Excel → MySQL → Power BI 

The objective was to identify profit drivers, loss-making products, discount impact, and regional performance to support executive decision-making.

# Business Problem
Leadership lacked visibility into:
• which products generate profit vs losses,
• how discounts affect margins,
• where returns impact revenue,
• which regions underperform, and
• what operational actions to take.

# Tools Used
• Excel — initial data exploration
• MySQL — transformations, joins, KPI computation
• Power BI — interactive executive dashboard

# SQL Work Performed
• Joined Orders and Returns tables.
• Aggregated sales and profit metrics.
• Built region, category, and segment performance tables.
• Prepared analytical datasets for BI

# Dashboard Capabilities
The Power BI dashboard enables:
• real-time profitability monitoring,
• identification of loss-making products, 
• analysis of discount impact,
• regional performance comparison, and
• return rate tracking.

# Key Insights
• Some product sub-categories consistently generate losses.
• High discounts significantly reduce profit margins.
• Returns contribute to hidden revenue loss.
• Sales growth does not always translate into profitability.
